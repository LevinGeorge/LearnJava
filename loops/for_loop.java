/**The syntax for the “for” loop is as follows:
	for(initialization; Boolean_expression; update)
	{
		//Statements
	}


 	When you are aware about that a task needs to be repeated several times, you can use the “for” loop.
 	It follows a structure where an integer is initialized, a condition is set with that integer, and then the integer is updated to a new value.
 	Now, after initialization, the integer is checked for the Boolean expression.
 	If found true, the code statements are executed. 
 	After this, the loop goes to the update statement and then again checks if the integer value satisfies the Boolean expression.
 	If yes, the steps for loop execution are repeated until the Boolean expression becomes false.

	
	Here is an example of the for loop:
