/**The Syntax for While loop is as follows â€“
	while(Boolean_expression)
	{
 		//Statements
 	}

 	This loop will execute when the Boolean expression is true. 
 	If the statement is false, the code will not enter the loop. 
 	The code will then go ahead with the statements that follow the while loop.
	
	Here is an example of the while loop:
